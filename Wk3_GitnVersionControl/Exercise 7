EXERCISE 7: Revert commit
Still on the bugfix branch. You also noticed a spelling mistake in the index.html file, so you want to fix that in the same branch.

Fix the spelling mistake and commit the fix
You also want to update the image.

So also change the image url (src) in a separate commit.
You are done with the changes:

git commit -m "image and spell"

Push both commits to the remote repository.
git push


Your team members tell you the previous image was the correct one, so you want to undo it. But since you already pushed to remote, you must revert the change.

Revert the last commit and push your changes to remote repository
git reset --hard HEAD~1 (clear both comit and changes) or 
git reset --soft head~1

git commit --amend
git push --force (avoid it in master/main/dev branch because it will break git connections for others when they need to push)

git revert <hash>
