EXERCISE 4 - Bugfix branch [Done]
You find out there is a bug in your project, so you need to fix it using a new bugfix branch:

#Create a new bugfix branch
git checkout -b bugfix/spelling-error

#Fix the spelling error in Application.java file
find * -name 'Application.java'
add d to Java App starte string  

You are done with the changes. So:

#Check your changes using "git diff" and
git diff

#Commit and push changes
git commit -m "Correct spell error in Application.jave file"
git push --set-upstream origin bugfix/spelling-error

Commit them if everything is correct.
Push your changes to your remote repository.
