EXERCISE 6: Fix merge conflict
You are on the bugfix branch. You notice the logger library version is old, so:

Update it to version 7.2 (Change the same location in bugfix branch)
Some time went by since you opened your bugfix branch, so you want the up-to-date master state to avoid major conflicts.

vim build.gradle
update to 7.2
git add .
git commit -m " Upgrade to 7.2 "
git push

Merge the master branch in your bugfix branch - fix the merge conflict!
git merge main
vim build.gradle
chose to upgrade to 7.3
