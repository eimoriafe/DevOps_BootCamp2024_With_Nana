Blob store
Nexus uses blob stores for storage of repo components(uploaded files)
Blob stores binary files, either locally or cloud like AWS S3
You can use one blob store for one repo or share across multiple repo, 
blob store config is found in sonatype-work folder(one of the two folder in nexus tar file)
The connection of a blob store to a repo is permanent and cannot be changed so plan carefully

--Component
A high-level definition of what is being uploaded to nexus, containing 1 or more assets which are the
actual files/packages that are eventually uploaded.

Component can be docker image, zip file or jar file

--Cleanup policies
pre-releases are also known as snapshots
component age is defined in days
Soft delete-marking component for deletion, does not free up space,
To delete from disk, we execute the compact blob store task.
