EXERCISE 2: Bash Script - Install Java (done)
Write a bash script using Vim editor that installs the latest java version and checks whether java was installed successfully by executing a java -version command.

After installation command, it checks 3 conditions:

1. whether java is installed at all
2. whether an older Java version is installed (java version lower than 11)
3. whether a java version of 11 or higher was installed
It prints relevant informative messages for all 3 conditions. Installation was successful if the 3rd condition is met and you have Java version 11 or higher available.

Solution:
EXERCISE 2:Shell script -Java installed
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script will install latest Java and show version "
apt update
apt -qq install -y default-jre

#Get java version and main version number
java_version=$(java --version | grep "openjdk" | awk '{print $1,$2}')
version_num=$(java --version | grep "openjdk" | awk '{print substr($2,0,2)}'

#check if java is present
if [ "$java_version" == "" ]
then
	echo "Java is not installed!"
  elif [ "$version_num" -le 11 ]
then
	echo "Older java is installed"
else
	echo "Installation successful! Java version $java_version is installed."
fi
