Context: We have a ready NodeJS application that needs to run on a server. The app is already configured to read in environment variables.

EXERCISE 6: Bash Script - Start Node App
Write a bash script with following logic: 

Install NodeJS and NPM and print out which versions were installed
Download an artifact file from the URL: https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz. Hint: use curl or wget
Unzip the downloaded file
Set the following needed environment variables: APP_ENV=dev, DB_USER=myuser, DB_PWD=mysecret
Change into the unzipped package directory
Run the NodeJS application by executing the following commands:  npm install and node server.js
Notes:

Make sure to run the application in background so that it doesn't block the terminal session where you execute the shell script
If any of the variables is not set, the node app will print error message that env vars is not set and exit
It will give you a warning about LOG_DIR variable not set. You can ignore it for now.


Solution
EXERCISE 6: Start Node App- 
#Refresh repo index
apt update

#Install NodeJS
apt install -y nodejs

#install NPM
apt install -y npm

#Get version of NodeJs and NPM and confirm both are installed
nodejs_version=$(nodejs --version)
npm_version=$(npm --version )

if [ -z "$nodejs_version" ] && [ -z "npm_version" ]
then
	echo "Nodejs $nodejs_version and Npm $npm_version installed not present."
else
	echo "Nodejs $nodejs_version and Npm $npm_version present and  installed."
fi

Get artefact from AWS repo
wget https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz.

#Unzip the tar file
tar -xvzf bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz

#Set environmental variables
export APP_ENV=dev
export DB_USER=myuser
export DB_PWD=mysecret
source ~/.bashrc

#Change directory to the directory of unzipped tar file
cd package/

#Run NodeJS server in background
npm install &
node server.js &
