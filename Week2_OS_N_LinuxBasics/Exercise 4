EXERCISE 4: Bash Script - User Processes Sorted (done)
Extend the previous script to ask for a user input for sorting the processes output either by memory or CPU consumption, and print the sorted list.

Solution:
EXERCISE 4: Bash Script - User processes Sorted with input cpu k3 or mem k4
#!/bin/bash
echo "**Mod-2-Exercise 4**"
echo "This prints the processes sorted by memory or CPU"

#Choose option
read -p "To sort by mem, enter m, or cpu, enter c: " col_num

#Print output based on option
if [ "$col_num" == "m" ]
then
	echo "Sorting out by memory."
	ps -aux | grep $USER | sort -nk4
elif [ "$col_num" == "c" ]
then
	echo "Sorting output by Cpu."
	ps -aux | grep $USER | sort -nk3 
fi
