EXERCISE 5: Bash Script - Number of User Processes Sorted
Extend the previous script to ask additionally for user input about how many processes to print. Hint: use head program to limit the number of outputs. 

Solution:
#!/bin/bash
echo "**Exercise 5****"
echo "To print the specific number of processes of the current user sorted by cpu or mem"

#Indicate the sorting column
read -p "To sort by mem, enter m, or cpu, enter c: " col_num

#Specify the number of processes
read -p "Confirm the number of user processes to display: " num_proc

if [ "$col_num" == "m" ]
then
	echo "Sorting out by memory."
	ps -aux | grep $USER | sort -nk4 | head -n $num_proc
elif [ "$col_num" == "c" ]
then
	echo "Sorting output by Cpu."
	ps -aux | grep $USER | sort -nk3 | head -n $num_proc
fi
