EXERCISE 3: Bash Script - User Processes (done)
Write a bash script using Vim editor that checks all the processes running for the current user (USER env var) and prints out the processes in console. Hint: use ps aux command and grep for the user.

Solution:
EXERCISE 3: Bash Script - User Processes
#!/bin/bash
echo "To print the processes of the current user"
ps -aux | grep $USER
(N.B- assign group execute permission)
