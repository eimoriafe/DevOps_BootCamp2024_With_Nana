Build automation in simple terms
test code-> build application -> push to repo -> deploy to server

jenkins - one of the BA tools on a dedicated server to do the above
jenkins- run tests, build artifacts,publish artifacts, deploy artifacts, send notifications,..
jenkins needs to integrate with many other tools like docker,rep, deployment servers and it does so with plugins
