Build automation in simple terms
test code-> build application -> push to repo -> deploy to server

jenkins - one of the BA tools on a dedicated server to do the above
jenkins- run tests, build artifacts,publish artifacts, deploy artifacts, send notifications,..
jenkins needs to integrate with many other tools like docker,rep, deployment servers and it does so with plugins

2 ways to install jenkins on server
it is directly on OS or as a container

Install jenkins (it needs port 8080)

to run docker container
sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 \ (for browser access).
-p 50000:50000 \ for master-worker nodes binding in a cluster of jenkins setup
-d (for detached mode) 
-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts \(for persistent volumes)
